I wanted to watch YouTube faster than 2x speed. So I wrote a chrome extension to let me do that. This also works on Firefox. 

# Function
Hold CTRL + either the "<" or ">" key to add 0.5 to the playback speed. There's no maximum playback speed, and the minimum is 0.1. You can see the playback rate in the bottom right.

Alternatively, hold the '\`' (back tick) key, press a number 1-9, and release. It'll set the video to that speed. Alternatively, hold the '\`' key, press two numbers (like 2 and then 3), and release, and it'll append a . between the first and second number (so the speed will be 2.3!). 

Finally, you can press "CTRL" and "A" to set the video playback speed to 10x until the end of the video.
